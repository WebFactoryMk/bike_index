  /           Bicycle registration is a vital part of keeping bikes safe.

  /         %p
  /           While we know not every registered bike that is stolen will be recovered, unregistered stolen bikes are almost guaranteed to never turn up again. This is why we created Bike Index â€“ to provide fast, free, and easy registration that people would actually want to use, so we could help recover stolen bikes.
  /         %p
  /           Just about everyone wants their bikes to be registered &mdash; but most people never bother to register on their own. It makes a lot of sense to register bikes right when they are sold - which is why we've partnered with Lightspeed Retail to do just that.
  /         %p
  /           We designed Bike Index from the outset to be a great way for bike shops to register bikes for their customers. If you register a bike for a customer, we will send them an email with the basic information about their bike in case they ever need it &mdash; and that's it.
  /         %p
  /           Registrants can log into the Index and edit their bikes later on, but they're protected even if they choose not to. Furthermore, Bike Index will never trade or sell their email, or send any sort of marketing to them. We just protect their bikes, for free, because it's what we do.

  /           Once you connect your Lightspeed account, we will register every bike you sell automatically (unless you write "Do not sell" in the sales note). If you'd prefer, you can make the integration wait for approval before registering the bikes though.
  /         %p
  /           We're an #{link_to "official integration with Lightspeed Retail", "http://www.lightspeedpos.com/retail/addons/", target: '_blank'} - you can find us in their

  /           And that's it. Every bike you sell will be registered, so long as you put in the customer's email and the bike has a serial number in the "serial number" field in Lightspeed.

  /           If a customer doesn't want to be registered, put "do not register" in the notes for the sale and we won't register the bike.
